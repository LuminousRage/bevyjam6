1,1,Narrator,"[Ali, young and often overlooked by his family of skilled magicians, has always felt like an outsider. While they hone their craft and perfect their magic, he longs for something more—power. Power that will earn their respect and prove he's more than just a boy. He's heard rumors of a hidden room deep within the estate, a forgotten chamber holding the family's most guarded secrets.]"
1,2,Narrator,"[Inside, the room is filled with shelves, each piled high with books—some ancient, some newly bound, all forgotten with time. But one catches his eye. A book, untouched, as if it has never seen the passing years. ]"
1,3,Narrator,"[As his fingers brush its cover, the air around him shifts. The other books begin to crumble, turning to dust, one after another, as if drawn into an inevitable collapse. A chain reaction. ]"
1,4,Narrator,"[The book grows heavier in his hands, reluctant to release him. Something unseen tugs at him, pulling him in. He opens it. A sharp pain lances through his skull.]"
1,5,Narrator,[And then...darkness.]
2,1,Narrator,"[As Ali regains consciousness, a voice echoes in his mind, sharp and demanding.]"
2,2,Mysterious Voice,"""I've been waiting so long for this. Get up already."""
2,3,Narrator,"[Ali pushes himself to his feet, his head spinning as the world around him begins to take shape. He blinks, struggling to comprehend his surroundings. He stands on a jagged rock platform, suspended high above an infinite sea of swirling, dark clouds.]"
2,4,Narrator,"[Suddenly, a deafening roar shakes the air, a voice booming from the heavens, its power vibrating through Ali's very bones. ]"
2,5,Commanding Voice,"""You stand in my domain now, mortal. Welcome to your doom!"""
2,6,Narrator,"[Ali stumbles back, his heart pounding, panic rising in his chest as his eyes dart around in terror.]"
2,7,Mysterious Voice,"""Quick, there's no time! Pick me up, I'm over here!"""
2,8,Narrator,"[Ali shakes his head, trying to clear the fog in his mind, his voice trembling with panic.]"
2,9,Ali,What is this place? Who are you? Where are you? What's happening?!
2,10,Mysterious Voice,"""The axe, Ali. A weapon of your bloodline, meant for you alone. Without it, you won't survive for long in this place."""
2,11,Ali,"""I don't even know what's happening here! How do you even know my name? Why don't you just explain—?"""
2,12,Mysterious Voice,"""There's no time for explanations! I'll explain soon enough—just pick up the axe. Now!"""
2,13,Narrator,"[Ali hesitates, his mind racing with uncertainty. But then his gaze locks onto the large axe resting on the ground. A strange pull tugs at him, almost like an unspoken invitation. Without fully thinking, he crouches and reaches for it. The moment his fingers touch the handle, he feels an immediate, unshakable connection—as if the axe was always meant to be in his hands.]"
2,14,Mysterious Voice,"""Well done. Now, you must prepare yourself. It's about to get dangerous. Take this time to get used to the axe—it's the only thing that will keep you alive here."""
3,1,Narrator,"[A mass of dark, slimy forms materializes in front of Ali, their glistening, gelatinous bodies pulsing with a sickly light. They writhe and twitch, closing in on him with unnatural speed.]"
3,2,Commanding Voice,"""Let's see how you fare against my creations!"""
3,3,Mysterious Voice,"""Slimes. They're weak, but there will be many more. Use the axe—get ready!"""
4,1,Mysterious Voice,"""Well done, Ali. You've survived the first wave."""
4,2,Ali,"""Are you gonna tell me what's going on now?"
4,3,Mysterious Voice,"""My name is Asad. I sealed myself away with Zha'kthar, an ancient monster. The seal has weakened, and I've seen a vision—you are the one who can stop him."""
4,4,Ali,"""A vision? Why me?"""
4,5,Asad,"""Your bloodline is the key. The seal brought you here because you are the only one who can defeat him."""
4,6,Zha'kthar,"""You will fail!"""
4,7,Asad,"""Stay focused, the real battle is just beginning."""
5,1,Asad,"""The seal weakens faster. Zha'kthar senses you now."""
5,2,Ali,"""What do I do? I don't even know what's going on!"""
5,3,Asad,"""You must stop him before he breaks free completely. It's your only choice."""
5,4,Zha'kthar,"""You are nothing. I will destroy you!"""
5,5,Asad,"""Focus! The next wave is worse."""
6,1,Ali,"""I can't keep this up!"""
6,2,Asad,"""You can. The only way out is through him. Zha'kthar's power is growing."""
6,3,Ali,"""I'm not ready!"""
6,4,Asad,"""You are. It's your blood, your destiny. He must be stopped now."""
6,5,Zha'kthar,"""You think you can stop me? You're weak!"""
6,6,Asad,"""You're not weak, Ali. You have what it takes. Don't doubt yourself."""
7,1,Asad,"""This is it. Zha'kthar's final form is coming."""
7,2,Ali,"""I don't know if I can do this..."""
7,3,Asad,"""You must. This is your moment."""
7,4,Zha'kthar,"""You cannot defeat me. I will consume you!"""
7,5,Asad,"""You've come this far. Now finish this."""
8,1,Ali,"""I... I did it. I stopped him."""
8,2,Asad,"""You've slain Zha'kthar, but that was only part of the chain. The seal is weakened now. The storm is far from over."""
8,3,Ali,"""What are you talking about? I stopped him. This nightmare should be over!"""
8,4,Asad,"""You've triggered a reaction. Zha'kthar's death didn't end the threat. It's just the beginning of something much worse...”"
8,5,Ali,"""What do you mean 'the beginning'?"""
8,6,Asad,"""The seal that kept him bound is crumbling. You have unwittingly begun a chain reaction. The realm is unstable. But you still have a chance to escape it."""
8,7,Ali,"""Escape? How?"
8,8,Asad,"""You can't. The realm will collapse soon. The destruction you've set in motion can't be stopped—but you can leave. You were always meant to break the chain. Now, leave this place, and return to your world."""
8,9,Ali,"""I don't know what's next, but I won't let this be in vain."""
8,10,Asad,"""Then go, Ali. I can only guide you so far. The rest is yours to choose."""
8,11,Ali,"""Goodbye, Asad. Thanks for showing me the way."""
8,12,Asad,"""Choose wisely. Don't let the chain bind you."""
